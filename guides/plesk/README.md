# Plesk

::: tip
The *best* deploy alternative for Chevereto is [Docker](../docker/README.md). But Chevereto can be deployed anywhere and this guide may suit your needs.
:::

Plesk is a web panel software available in managed servers, which are machines where the system libraries are installed and provisioned by your provider. In managed servers there's no need to install packages or compile libraries as Plesk provides an user interface for configuring the server.

This deploy alternative doesn't require tech knowledge. But it comes at a cost as the system infrastructure is not on your control. If you are new to self-hosted and need the convenience of an easy system with user interface this is a good starting point.

## Requirements

* Plesk based hosting service
* Chevereto license

## Purchase hosting
