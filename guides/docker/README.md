Docker refers to container technology, which has changed the way we run applications. With containers you don't need to worry about PHP versioning, missing extensions, virtual host configuration, anything.

This deploy alternative provides portability of your installation and superb maintenance. But it comes at a cost as running applications in containers could be challenging as container technology involves several *layers* which means a tall documentation footprint. If you enjoy learning this is a good starting point.
