Chevereto V4 is [PHP](https://php.net/) software, it has been designed using:

* [Chevere](https://chevere.org/)
* [PHP packages](https://deb.sury.org/) from Ond≈ôej Sur√Ω.
* [PHP extensions](https://www.php.net/manual/en/extensions.membership.php) provided by [PECL](https://pecl.php.net/).

üëâ Packages and PECL provides the same convenience, but as packages are made for debian-based systems, you should prefer PECL if you don't have a debian-compatible system.

üí° Packages not only contain the software, it could trigger other effects in the system.

## What it does?

PHP is the programming language used to write Chevereto application instructions, it is used for everything as it provides high flexibility to alter instructions on-the-fly at a minimum system performance footprint.

## Troubleshoot

Having issues? Check the following common pitfalls:

* Outdated PHP version
* Misconfiguration in PHP libraries
* Bad php.ini directives
* Low execution time
* Bad sessions setup
* Open basedir restrictions

## PHP Configuration

The following `ini` values are recommended for Chevereto installations.

```sh
upload_max_filesize = 64M;
post_max_size = 64M;
max_execution_time = 30;
memory_limit = 512M;
```

| Property            | Description                                      | Example             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| upload_max_filesize | Maximum upload size                              | `64M` for 64 MB     |
| post_max_size       | Maximum post size                                | Same as above       |
| max_execution_time  | Maximum time to execute the software, in seconds | `30` for 30 seconds |
| memory_limit        | Maximum memory to allocate                       | `512M` for 512 MB   |

You can toggle this limits to reflect your hardware and server load. Check this article for more info: [PHP common pitfalls](http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.common-pitfalls.php).

## PHP Extensions

The following PHP extensions are required for Chevereto.

* curl
* ds
* exif
* fileinfo
* gd
* hash
* imagick
* json
* mbstring
* pdo
* pdo-mysql
* session
* xml
* zip

## PHP Features

Chevereto requires unrestricted access to **all PHP functions**. Note that the following functions **should not** be restricted:

* [set_time_limit](https://www.php.net/set-time-limit)

## PHP Image library

The image library (GD, Imagick) should be provided with support for `PNG GIF JPG BMP WEBP`. By default, Chevereto prefers Imagick and fallback to GD.

üëâ If you need to explicit use GD you can pass this [ENV](../configuration/environment.md#image-handling-variables):

```php
CHEVERETO_IMAGE_LIBRARY=gd
```

üëâ If the server doesn't provide support for all the image formats handled by Chevereto, the ENV must reflect only the system supported formats. In the following example Chevereto is configured with explicit support only for PNG, GIF, BMP and JPG (removes WEBP):

```php
CHEVERETO_IMAGE_FORMATS_AVAILABLE='["JPG","PNG","BMP","GIF"]'
```

### Configuring ImageMagick

Additional recommended ImageMagick configuration at `/etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml` file:

```xml
<policymap>
    <!-- policies -->
    <policy domain="resource" name="width" value="16KP"/>
    <policy domain="resource" name="height" value="16KP"/>
</policymap>
```

## PHP Filesystem

User running `php` must be in the owner group of your installation directory. This is required to allow Chevereto to modify the filesystem for uploading features.

Chevereto user will require **read/write** access in the following paths:

* `/tmp`
* `app/*`
* `content/*`
* `images/*`
* `importing/*`
