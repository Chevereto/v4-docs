## What it does?

The MySQL server is used to interact with the database storing relational data, for which Chevereto links users to media, content to reactions, folders, etc. That relational data is what is used to define what your application "is".

## Permissions

Database user must have `ALL PRIVILEGES` over the target database.

## Storage engine

InnoDB table storage engine.

::: danger Upgrading from old versions
Old versions using MyISAM table storage engine will require to convert the old tables to InnoDB. Read [Convert MyISAM tables to InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/converting-tables-to-innodb.html)
