# ðŸ˜Œ Upgrading from free

You can upgrade from any free edition to paid Chevereto V4.

## chevereto/chevereto

Users of [chevereto/chevereto](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto) need to follow the [Updating](updating.md) documentation using the paid edition files.

If you are using [Docker](../../guides/docker/README.md) you will need to build the container image and re-start your containers.

## rodber/chevereto-free
