# From free

You can upgrade from any free edition to paid Chevereto.

## chevereto/chevereto

Users of [chevereto/chevereto](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto) can one-click upgrade from the dashboard panel.

* Go to `/dashboard`
* Click on **License key** button
* Enter license key and click on **Save changes**
* Follow the on-screen upgrade instructions

To manual upgrade follow the [Updating](updating.md) documentation using the paid edition files.

**Note:** [Docker](../../guides/docker/README.md) users don't need any of these steps, simply re-build the container image ([make image](https://github.com/chevereto/docker/blob/4.0/docs/BUILDING.md) or [docker build](https://github.com/chevereto/docker/blob/4.0/docs/PURE-DOCKER.md)) and re-start your containers.
