### chevereto/docker

## Using Release package

The release package is a `zip` file containing the software files. Once extracted, the software is ready to be updated.

ðŸ‘‰ This method is recommended for **cPanel**, **Plesk** and all other **web panel** users.

* Upload the [latest release](https://chevereto.com/panel/downloads) package to a non-public path in your server
* Unzip the software using your server built-in `unzip` utility in the target website directory (usually the `public_html` folder)
* Remove the `.zip` file
* Open your target website URL at `/install`

## Using Composer package manager

Using Composer the update carried in CLI context. It requires:

* CLI with `curl`, `unzip`
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

    -H "License: $LICENSE" \
    "https://chevereto.com/api/download/4-lite" \
