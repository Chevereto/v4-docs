ðŸ’¡ Review [Chevereto V4 vs V3](../../introduction/changelog/welcome-back.md#chevereto-v4-vs-v3) comparison tables for a better understanding of changes in V4.

## Requirements

* Existing installation running Chevereto V3.20
* Backup for the existing previous installation (optional, recommended)

### Test install (optional)

It is recommended to check first that a new Chevereto V4 installation can install and run in the target server. This is for detecting any conflicting requirement.

ðŸ’¡ Don't worry about license-domain restrictions. This is just a test install.

* Create a new website
* [Install](installation.md) Chevereto V4
* Make sure it works without issues

If everything goes well you can delete this test installation and try it for real. If not, then go to [Bug Tracking](https://chv.to/bug-tracking) to share your findings.

## Upgrade to V4

Upgrade to Chevereto V4 is performed by overriding the previous software files with the new files provided by Chevereto V4.

Follow these without skipping any step:

* Remove `app/vendor` from your Chevereto V3 installation
* Override Chevereto V3 files with Chevereto V4 files
* Switch to PHP 8
* Create [app/env.php](../configuration/env.php.md) (see remark below)
* Proceed with [database update](updating.md##database-update)

### Application settings

Chevereto V4 uses a new [configuration](../configuration/configuring.md) standard. You must update your settings accordingly.

* Update `app/settings.php` to `app/env.php` (note: different format!)
* (Alternative) Provide system environment variables

### CRON

Chevereto V4 comes with a new console. You must update your [CRON](../stack/cron.md) command to point to the new location.

From Chevereto V3:

```sh
cli.php -C cron
```

To Chevereto V4:

```sh
app/bin/legacy -C cron
```
