## Requirements

* Existing installation running Chevereto V3.20
* Backup for the existing previous installation (optional, recommended)

### Test install (optional)

It is recommended to check first that a new Chevereto V4 installation can install and run in the target server. This is for detecting any conflicting requirement.

ðŸ’¡ Don't worry about license-domain restrictions. This is just a test install.

* Create a new website
* [Install](installation.md) Chevereto V4
* Make sure it works without issues

If everything goes well you can delete this test installation and try it for real. If not, then go to [Bug Tracking](https://chv.to/bug-tracking) to share your findings.

* Provide Chevereto V4 files on top of Chevereto V3 installation
* Switch to PHP 8
* Proceed with [database update](updating.md##database-update)
