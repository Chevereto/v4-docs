# ðŸš€ Upgrading

This section outlines the upgrade process required to install V4 from the previous major release (V3).

## Requirements

* A new V4 installation for [test install](#test-install)
* Existing installation running Chevereto V3.20.X `latest-release`
* Backup for the existing previous installation (told you)

## Test install

It is **recommended** to check that a new V4 installation can install/run in the target machine. Don't worry about license-domain restrictions as this is just a test install.

* Create a new website to install Chevereto V4
* Confirm that the system installs successful and that admin user can login

Once done, you can delete this test installation.

## Upgrade to V4

Upgrade to V4 is performed by providing the software files on top of the existing Chevereto V3 installation. This process is exactly the same as updating, but V4 uses `app/env.php` for system settings. Update settings keys accordingly.

## Congratulations

ðŸ¥³ That's all, wasn't that hard isn't?
