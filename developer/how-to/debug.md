# üêû Debug

Debug enables to dump information about errors that may be affecting the software functionality. If Chevereto isn't working properly it will require debugging to understand the situation.

## XR Debug

<p><img alt="XR Debug" width="17%" class="float-left margin-1em" src="../../src/products/xr/logo.svg"></p>

üëè Chevereto V4 includes **built-in support** for [XR Debug](https://xr-docs.chevere.org), an Open Source remote debugger also made by us.

You can [enable XR Debug](https://v4-admin.chevereto.com/dashboard/system#enable-xr) server to get live debug messages, enabling you to save/export those for handling it over when [requesting help](troubleshoot.md#getting-help).

### Built-in XR Debug server

Run the following command to spawn the built-in XR Debug server:

```php
php /var/www/html/app/vendor/chevere/xr/server.php -p 27420
```

üí° The command instructions are also available in your [Admin Dashboard](https://v4-admin.chevereto.com/).

## Configuring debug

Debug can be [configured](../../application/configuration/configuring.md) using [environment variables](../../application/configuration/environment.md#debug-variables).

### Debug level

üí° Depending on the work context debug needs to be configured accordingly.

::: warning Note on debug levels
Error level >= 2 is not recommended for production environments. Is not safe to print the errors to the screen, handle it with care.
:::

| Level (N) | Description                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 0         | No debug                             |
| 1         | Debug to `log_device`                |
| 2         | Print errors (no logging)            |
| 3         | Print errors and log to `log_device` |

Use `CHEVERETO_DEBUG_LEVEL=N` to configure the debug level.

### Log device

Configure your own error log device to control where the logs will be sent. If you don't alter this it will fallback to the default system log device.

‚úÖ Containers will always log to `/dev/stderr` regardless this setting.

Use `CHEVERETO_ERROR_LOG=log_device` to configure where logs will be sent in non-container context.

## Accessing logs

If you don't configure [log device](#log-device) Chevereto will follow the default [error_log](https://www.php.net/manual/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.error-log) handling configured for your PHP installation.

### Where are the default logs?

This vary depending the server provider and how PHP runs in the server. In doubt, check/ask first to your system administrator.

* XR Debug
  * Streams the debug messages to the XR Debug session
* PHP
  * Logs by default at `syslog`
* Apache
  * Logs by default at `/var/log/apache2/error.log`
  * Virtual host directive defines custom error log location
  * Commonly configured for `/var/www/domain.com/logs`
* NGINX
  * Logs by default at `/var/log/nginx/error.log`
  * Server block defines custom error log location
  * Commonly configured for `/var/www/domain.com/logs`
* cPanel
  * Logs by default at `../domain.com.error.log` (parent of `public_html` folder)
  * Vary a lot from providers and cPanel version
* Docker
  * Logs to `/dev/stderr`

### I can't find the logs

You can configure `CHEVERETO_DEBUG_LEVEL` >= 2 but note that this error reporting level **could compromise** your installation. Restrict any public access to your website and revert to `CHEVERETO_DEBUG_LEVEL=1` as soon as possible.

If you can't find the logs or you are having a hard time with this you can request [Extra Support](https://chevereto.com/support) so we can safely debug your installation.

### Reading logs

Logs can be accessed by direct file access or by running commands:

<code-group>
<code-block title="Shell">
```sh
tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log | sed 's/\\n/\n/g'
```
</code-block>

<code-block title="Docker">
```sh
docker logs -f container-name | sed 's/\\n/\n/g'
```
</code-block>
</code-group>

## Error reporting

üí° Enable this **only** in development environments.

To enable printed error reporting you will need to go to [system settings](https://v4-admin.chevereto.com/dashboard/system). By enabling this, all runtime errors will be printed to the screen, handle it with care.
