`🚧 Work in progress`

With plugins you can dramatically change what Chevereto V4 does, from adding validations, media optimization, filters, etc. You can customize the system to fit exactly to your needs.

Pluggable layers in Chevereto V4 allows to modify or extend default functionality by using plugins. Enabling adding, removing or modifying exactly what you need.
