## What is Chevereto?

Chevereto is a self-hosted multi-user, full-featured media hosting solution. It can be used to create a myriad of applications or to empower existing systems, all around the concept of users hosting and interacting with media content.

## Use cases

Chevereto on its core provides an image hosting service that you can configure to use it in different contexts. It is a turnkey system with many applications, including:

* Image host/sharing service
* Image-based sharing communities
* Image-driven portfolios
* Photography showcase
* Asset image storage

Chevereto could be used to build your store's gallery, a client portfolio, manage thousand of media assets and more. From a simple media gallery up to end-users interacting with each-other, Chevereto can leverage all the load of the media sharing layer for your project.

The point of Chevereto is that it handles *very* large image collections and is optimized for network usage. Chevereto has been designed to provide image hosting and sharing at large scale.

## Origin

Chevereto began in 2007 as a self-hosted alternative to ImageShack. It started as one-click image hosting service and here we are. You can learn the complete history [releases.chevereto.com](https://releases.chevereto.com)
