## What is Chevereto?

Chevereto is a self-hosted multi-user, full-featured media hosting solution. It can be used to create a myriad of applications or to empower existing systems, all around the concept of users hosting and interacting with media content.

## Use cases

Chevereto default use case is as a media hosting service, but it can be easily extended to do more than that. The API is fully pluggable and the system is modular, you can implement it progressively in any project. Chevereto could be used to build your store's gallery, a client porfolio, manage thousand of media assets and more.

From a simple media gallery up to end-users interacting with each-other, Chevereto can leverage all the load of the media sharing layer for your project.

## Core Concepts

### Community Driven

A [community](https://chevereto.com/community) drives the development for Chevereto. Users from all over the world help to shape this software.

### Headless

Chevereto is headless software, on its core is a self-exposed REST API made for _any_ user interface.

Although it provides a default [user interface](https://github.com/chevereto/peafowl), you are encouraged to bring your own user interface, which it can be a website, desktop, mobile application, CLI tool, and pretty much whatever.

### Pluggable

Chevereto is designed with pluggable logic, enabling you to add exactly what you need to make it more yours. Use plugins to extend your installation and to create a better user experience for your unique needs.

## Origin

Chevereto began in 2007 as a self-hosted alternative to ImageShack. It started as one-click image hosting service and here we are.
