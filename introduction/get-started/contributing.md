# ðŸ’– Contributing

Contribute to Chevereto to show your support and care for the software. Anyone can contribute, don't hesitate to [contact us](https://chevereto.com/contact) if you have something in your mind not covered here.

## Show and Tell

The best way you can support us is by spreading the word about the software we do. We don't waste money on adversiting nor marketing as everything goes to development. We really depend on users like you to promote our work.

ðŸ‘‰ Go and tell others what Chevereto does and how you use it.

## Documentation

We are also humans. We make typing mistakes, sometimes we may provide complex instructions too hard to follow, etc. If something in this documentation is wrong or in need of improving let us know!

ðŸ‘‰ This [documentation](https://github.com/chevereto/v4-docs) is Open Source and anyone can contribute to make it better.

## Servers

Chevereto is self-hosted software running in virtually endless system configurations and use cases. While the software is capable of this feat, in many cases it may show incompatibility issues which at the same time are very hard to narrow down.

Hosting providers and heavy users are adviced to donate us servers for this purpose.

ðŸ‘‰ We always need access to commercial available servers to make compatibility tests and checking.
