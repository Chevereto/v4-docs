## User-based API

🎉 API available to all users.

With the API users can interact with Chevereto from another system, i.e. to upload screenshoots using [ShareX](https://v4-user.chevereto.com/integrations/sharex.html) directly to the user's account.

## Theme palettes

🎨 Give color.

Macanudo includes user-selectable theme palettes with plenty of choices to pick from. Users can preview palettes on the fly and easy switch colors directly from their profile menu.

## Folder upload

📂 Drag-and-drop without hassle.

Simple as drop the folder on the uploader screen, it detects compatible files and queue those for the upload process. 

## Improved mobile experience

## Faster html rendering

🏎 The fast and the htmlorious.

Listings, TFFB and HTML rendering have been massively improved with lazy load listings and a myriad of enhancements to make your websites load faster.

## Keyboard shortcuts

⌨️ Do more in less time.

All buttons include a keyboard shortcut binding to provide a richer user experience. Macanudo makes content management delightful productive as it chops all these roundtrips of the trackpad.

Authentication using TOTP enables users to strength their accounts by adding a second security layer. If someone gets access to a user password it will be useless without the two-factor device.
